# Hi, I'm Omogbai.

I'm a web developer that loves to solve problems, develop existing skills/technologies and learn new ones. I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Next.js.. and I look forward to learning more.

I'm presently a freelancer, looking for a role as a software engineering intern and you can reach me [here] (https://omogbai-atakpu.netlify.app/).
